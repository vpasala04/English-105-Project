# English-105-Project

This is a repsoitory containing instructional materials and sample datasets for Prof. Gotzler's Fall 2022 sections of ENGL-105 at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill

This repository contains a .csv file to County Public Health Data from 2014-2015, and python notebooks covering basic topics in modifying the County Public Health .csv dataset into a simpler data analysis of a specific issue

The 3 python notebooks in this repository contains information as follows:
  - A basic introduction to using the python coding language
  - A basic introduction to using the Pandas package
  - Using the Pandas package to manipulate, modify, and prepare large chunks of data for       analysis

The .csv data was gathered from County Public Health Data from various States in the U.S., and obtained by Prof. Gotzler and adapted by the UNC Research Hub in the Davis Library.

## Provenance

As mentined above, the County Public Health Data .csv was obtained through lesson plans adapted by the UNC Research Hub in the Davis Library.

The python code was from a notebook created in the Jupyter software retrieved from the Anaconda Navigator application.

The bar graph visualization analysis was created using the Flourish software (website) through an imported google sheets file.

## Purpose

This data is to be used by anyone trying to study or examine trends in specific public health issues; in this respository, we will be focuisng on the 

This respsitory can also be of use to anyone starting to explore data manipulation and simple data analysis using the python coding language.

## Potential

This repository was created in order to explore and gain understanding for obtaining data and analyzing it through simple coding and visualization methods. Some may use the data in this repository to do more extensive data analysis amongst multiple variables of County Health Public Data for a larger project, or simply get an introduction to simple coding practices in python.
